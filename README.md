## Description

This dataset for Sydney, Australia, represents land cover, building morphology, vegetation morphology and other parameters 
appropriate for input into local or mesoscale urban climate models.

The dataset is provided in netCDF4 and GeoTiff formats.

The python code `resample_geoscape_from_template.py` processes Geoscape Australia datasets for Buildings v2.0, 
Trees v1.6 and Surface cover v1.6 into lower resolution versions. For further details refer to the manuscipt:

"A transformation in city-descriptive input data for urban climate models: Frontiers in Environmental Science 2022"

The python code `plot_derived_dataset.py` plots select land cover and morphology parameters (figure outputs are included here).

## Version 1.01

This dataset version differs slightly from the one described in the associated paper, with the following changes.

- the ~ 300 m grid is based on the global European Space Agency CCI Global Land Cover dataset: https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/
- additional land surface tiles are included where previously set to nan
- land surface tiles which did not sum to 1.0 were excluded (14 tiles)
- building height mean and standard deviation is still calculated from the average of Geoscape roof (max) and eave (min) heights. 
  An optional processing step is applied to account for buildings covering multiple grids where building vector information 
  is burnt to a raster and then area weighted to calculate grid-level statistics. This requires much longer processing time, 
  as well as additional  modules (GeoCube), however avoids the previous issue of the statistics of buildings over multiple grids
  being applied to one grid only. 
- building height maximum is now based only on Geoscape roof height (i.e. the maximum measured height). Again, an optional
  processing step is included based on rasterised data.
- the category lowveg_fraction is now partitioned into grass_fraction and shrub_fraction to allow seperate inputs used by some models

## Inputs:

- building_height_std: standard deviation of building height in grid cell (avg. of geoscape roof and eave height)
- wall_density: sum of building wall area as fraction of grid area
- frontal_density: sum of cardinally averaged building frontal area as fraction of grid area
